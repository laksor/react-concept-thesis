/* 

It aims to help with handling async operations by 
letting you wait for some code to load and declaratively 
specify a loading state (like a spinner) while waiting. 
It allows you to defer rendering part of your application tree 
until some condition is met (for example, data from an endpoint 
or a resource is loaded).
